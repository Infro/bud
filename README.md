# Bud

> * Latest version: [0.4.0](https://github.com/urbas/bud/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

Is a project automation tool for your C# projects. Bud downloads your project's local and external dependencies,
builds your project, tests it, deploys it, releases it, and automates any project-related tasks you desire.

Bud lets you write the build configuration in pure C#, so you can use Visual Studio to write your project automation.

## Installation

See [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for the latest version.
