## About

Bud is a build tool.

## Quick start

1. Create a `Build.cs` file in the top folder of your project.

1. Run it with `Bud.RunScript.exe`.

See [samples](Samples) for examples on what Bud can do for you.

__TODO__: Needs easy installation instructions.

__TODO__: The tool to run the script should be called `bud.exe` (`bud` on Unix).

__TODO__: Integrate with [Bud.Building](https://github.com/urbas/Bud.Building).

## Core principles

1. Bud's build scripts are just C# code.

1. In addition, Bud provides some easy to use libraries with which you can write clean and powerful build scripts.
